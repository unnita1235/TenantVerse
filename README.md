## 📝 Current Limitations

This is a **UI prototype** designed to showcase frontend development skills. Key limitations:

1. **No Authentication**: Login/signup pages are UI only
2. **No Database**: All data is static/hardcoded
3. **No API**: No backend server running
4. **No Persistence**: Changes don't save anywhere
5. **Demo Only**: Not ready for production use
